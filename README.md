Tree-Using Really Unorthodox Language: The modern meta-programming system

Description
===========

This repository holds the code and text for my MSc thesis in which I am writing a whole programming environment supporting extensible meta-programming by providing a minimal yet scriptable compilation system (hopefully) with an editor.

The system core for bootstrapping is written in C++14, but further language elements will be provided in turul itself.

The goal is a general system that can compile any context-free grammar providing handy ways to expand syntax and semantics while staying as minimal and simple as possible using "suckless.org philosophy" through the code!

Repository structure
====================

	docs/   - contains documentation and (Hungarian) text of my thesis
	src/    - contains a LightWeightComponents pattern based system (will elaborate later)

LICENCING
=========

This work is provided in a dual licenced structure. Source code contents below "src/" are licenced under LGPLv3, whilst technical documentation and thesis texts are under OSSPL (Open source scientific Public Licence) below "docs/". Please refer to the individual licence files below each folder for full understanding.

Licencing of documentations differently was necessary to ensure I can finish writing my thesis properly so there had to be a LICENCE which guards my thesis-related textual informations while keeping everything in open. I hope this is being understood as the licence is there only for this purpose and not to annoy people. I would not be able to work this openly without that I think but lately when I had some health problems I had a dream where I have put everything up to github and I felt something bad can happen if I don't do that. So working here openly is driven by this motivation too and I like open sourcing anyways just please respect that I would still love to finish my MSc in the meantime while trying to provide something useful.
