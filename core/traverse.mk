#
# Usage:
#
# Part of root Makefile using TRAVERSE may look like:
##
#   include $(MK_DIR)/traverse.mk
#   TRAVERSE_CALLBACK = \
#       OBJS_ALL := $$(OBJS_ALL) $$(addprefix $(NODE_DIR)/,$(NODE_OBJS))
#   $(eval $(call TRAVERSE,$(SRC_DIR),node.mk,TRAVERSE_CALLBACK))
#
#   all: $(OBJS_ALL)
#    @$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -T $(LDSCRIPT) -o $(TARGET) $(OBJS_ALL)
##
#
# node.mk files placed in each sub-directory should contain something like:
##
#   SUBDIRS-y              += irq
#   SUBDIRS-$(CONFIG_TEST) += test
#
#   OBJS-y                 += main.o
#   OBJS-y                 += init.o
#   OBJS-$(CONFIG_TIMER)   += timer.o
#
#   LIBS-y                 += lib.a
##
# Each time before node.mk is included variables SUBDIRS-y, OBJS-y, and LIBS-y
# are set to empty string, and SELFDIR contains location of node.mk to be
# processed.
#
# Enjoy!

# Walks the directory tree starting at the specified root,
# processing node descriptors with given file name
# and invoking user-defined callback (if any).
#
# Params:
#  1. Root directory
#  2. File name of node descriptor containing info about subdirs and objects
#  3. (optional) Expression to evaluate as a callback after processing the node
#                with the following interface:
      NODE_DIR      =$(1)# 1. Directory containing the node descriptor 
      NODE_FILE     =$(2)# 2. Descriptor file name
      NODE_SUBDIRS  =$(3)# 3. Enabled sub-directories
      NODE_OBJS     =$(4)# 4. Enabled objects
      NODE_LIBS     =$(5)# 5. Enabled libraries
      NODE_DEPTH    =$(6)# 6. Call depth
#      (see TRAVERSE_CALLBACK_EXAMPLE as an example)
#
TRAVERSE =$(call traverse_process_node,$(1),$(2),$(3),.)

#
# The callback for TRAVERSE that traces its input arguments.
# Just to show how it can be implemented.
# Note that everything except variables with NODE_ prefix should be escaped
# (because of using 'eval' function, see 'make' manual).
